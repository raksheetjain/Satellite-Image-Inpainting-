#  Satellite Images inpainting using GANs

This repository contains code and resources for a research project focused on satellite images inpainting using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).  
## Introduction

Advanced Earth observation satellites generate valuable data for various applications in ecosystem research, disaster monitoring, and more. However, one significant challenge is the presence of environmental effects such as cloud and fog, which can render a portion of the data unusable. This research demonstrates the use of GANs to remove cloud and fog from Landsat multispectral data, allowing for the production of uninterrupted satellite datastreams.

## Repository Contents

- **Code**: This directory contains the source code used for cloud and fog removal using GANs. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts.

- **Data**: Here, you can find sample satellite images used in the research. Please note that this repository may not contain the complete dataset used in the research, but you can refer to the HAL preprint for more details.

- **Documentation**: This directory holds documentation and research papers related to the project. It includes the preprint paper and any additional documentation that provides insights into the research methodology.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-fog-removal.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `Code` directory:

   ```
   cd cloud-fog-removal/Code
   ```

3. Follow the instructions provided in the code files to preprocess data, train the GAN model, and evaluate its performance.
